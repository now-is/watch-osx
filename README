Old code: watchers for OS X, of varying usefulness.

Watch files and directories for changes, watch power events and USB events.

The watcher for files and dirs, watch.c, works reasonably well on "many
versions" of OS X.

I did not ultimately use watchusb and watchpower a whole lot. Their behavior
and output formats differ from watchfile and watchdir, but would be easy to
change.

watchfile, watchdir, and watch have similar behaviors. Usage:

watchfile file1 [... file16]
watchdir dir1 [... dir16]
watch path1 [... path16]

Each of these blocks and waits. At the first detected change to any of the specified
paths, it prints a line of the form:

eventlist<tab>path

and exits.

Eventlist is a |-separated list of events, often just one event. Examples:

DELETE|LINK<tab>test
DIRMOD<tab>/tmp/test.d/
ATTRIB<tab>/tmp/touched


Why?

You could put watch commands in a loop to get various monitoring effects,
recompile/"live reload" perhaps in combination with Applescript, restart
services on wake via daemontools, etc. Many possibilities.

There is no make, unfortunately. Edit build.sh and run.

There are no guarantees, unfortunately.

The code is adapted from Apple's ostensibly public pages. Let me know ...
